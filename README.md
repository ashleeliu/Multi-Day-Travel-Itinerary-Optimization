# Multi-Day-Travel-Itinerary-Optimization

This project was completed as part of IEOR 164 (Introduction to Optimization Modeling). The objective was to formulate and solve a mixed-integer optimization model to design a cost-efficient, well-balanced three-day travel itinerary to Sequoia National Park under realistic constraints.

The model integrates real-world considerations such as lodging selection, transportation costs, activity scheduling, time windows, and traveler fatigue. It demonstrates how decision analytics and optimization techniques can be applied to everyday planning problems.
